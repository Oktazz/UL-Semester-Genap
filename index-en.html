            <h2>History of Sambirenteng</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time, there was a kingdom located on the edge of the Batur Caldera, in Kintamani District, Bangli Regency. The kingdom's territory was vast, reaching as far as the Batu Sungu landmark in the northern part of the realm.
                <br><br>
                The kingdom was called Bali-Ingkang, and legend has it that its king was a descendant of Sri Aji Maya Denawa.

                At one time, the Bali-Ingkang Kingdom was attacked by enemies, and the king was forced to retreat to a dense forested area on a hill located to the north of the kingdom.
                <br><br>
                There, the king stayed (in Balinese, makolem) for quite some time. Today, this forested hilly area is known as Alas Metahun or Alas Makolem. Once the kingdom was reclaimed, the king returned to resume his rule.
                <br><br>
                When the Bali-Ingkang Kingdom was about to be attacked by the forces of Sri Arya Gajah Para, the king dispatched a military unit known as the Kanca, consisting of two hundred soldiers (Kanca Satak), tasked with defending the northern part of the kingdom. This unit built a fortress in the northeastern region of the kingdom, which is now known as Tembok Village.
                <br><br>
                The central command post was established in a very dense forest called Kayu Samah, where one hundred soldiers were stationed.
                <br><br>
                Whenever the commander issued orders to his troops, he would say "Sami-Ranta" (an Old Balinese phrase meaning "All Ready").
                <br><br>
                Over time, this forested area of Kayu Samah, which served as a command center where everyone was always ‚ÄúSami-Ranta‚Äù (all ready), gradually became known as Sambirenteng ‚Äî the name of the village today.

                            <p>
                                Cakcakan is a traditional rooster-matching ritual held by the customary village community of Sambirenteng.
                                <br>
                                According to the beliefs of the Sambirenteng people, in the past, as Tilem Kepitu (the seventh new moon) approached, strange and unusual occurrences began to take place in the village. In response, the village elders engaged in deep meditation. During this meditation, they received a pawisik (spiritual message or divine revelation) instructing them to perform a pecaruan cakcakan‚Äîa ritual offering involving the rooster-matching ceremony.
                                <br>
                                Following this spiritual guidance, the Cakcakan ceremony was held, which later developed into the Cakcakan Tradition, observed annually during Tilem Kepitu.

                                In the Negakang / Megibung tradition, the community brings rice and meat dishes from the Cakcakan ritual offerings, known as be cundang. This tradition takes place in the village center, where all the villagers gather and take their designated seats.
                                <br>
                                The signal to begin the tradition is given by the sounding of the kul-kul (a traditional bamboo slit drum), played by the village priest (pemangku).

                                Everything is done simultaneously, symbolizing the unity and togetherness of the people of Sambirenteng Village.

                                The Ngerebeg ceremony is held annually on Tilem Kawolu (the eighth new moon). This ceremony is a form of offering to the village‚Äôs spiritual guardians in the unseen realm (niskala), intended to maintain the balance and safety of the village.
                                <br>
                                The tradition involves several stages, such as megibung (communal dining), ngocorin, and a procession around the village.
                                <br>
                                The megibung in this ceremony is different from that in the Negakang tradition. In Ngerebeg, the megibung is dedicated specifically to the unseen spiritual guardians of the village.
